e-commerce website Automation Testing Demo

Test Site: AutomationExercise.com

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains an automated UI testing framework built with Selenium WebDriver (Java) to validate key user flows on AutomationExercise.com, a demo e-commerce site. Designed to demonstrate:

End-to-end (E2E) testing of critical user journeys (e.g., login, checkout).

Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for maintainable code.

Integration with CI/CD (GitHub Actions).
